# Implementation of an I2C Communication Network in Verilog
This Vivado project folder contains the design source files implementing the master and slave nodes on an I2C network, along with multiple simulation testbench sources. 
## What is I2C? 
I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit refers to a half-duplex, serial, bidirectional communication network and protocol, primarily used for data transfers across multiple ICs on the same ASIC or PCB. This low-level communication system consists of two bidirectional lines with master and slave nodes connected to these line in an open-drain configuration.
